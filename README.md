Test assignment for tracking users and building routes to them. The goal is to get users and their vehicles from server (sync once per day), get their locations (sync every 30 sec.), show it on map (location update on map every minute) and build root (with Google Directions API).

3rd party frameworks I choosed (managed by Cocoapods):
* AFNetworking
* MagicalRecord
* GoogleMaps
* DateTools
